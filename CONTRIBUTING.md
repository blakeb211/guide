# Contributions welcome

1. The TODO.md file has a roadmap and suggestions for ideas
1. Current goals for the library (not met yet--will you help?) a) be statistically compatible with GUIDE for the currently targeted subset described in the todo list, b) be easy to read and modify, c) be fast enough for production, d) reduce dependencies
1. Recommend looking through the todo list and coming up with something that contributes to these goals
1. A lot of the notes should be demystified after looking at Loh's papers in the docs folder, starting with the 2002 paper. Much of the code is a direct implementation of that paper.
