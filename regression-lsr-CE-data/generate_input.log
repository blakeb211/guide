 0. Read the warranty disclaimer
 1. Create a GUIDE input file
 Input your choice: 1
 Name of batch input file: cons.in
 Input 1 for model fitting, 2 for importance or DIF scoring, 3 for data conversion ([1:3], <cr>=1): 
 Name of batch output file: cons.out
 Input 1 for single tree, 2 for ensemble ([1:2], <cr>=1): 
 Input 1 for classification, 2 for regression, 3 for propensity score grouping
 Input your choice ([1:3], <cr>=1): 2
 Choose type of regression model:
  1=linear, 2=quantile, 3=Poisson, 4=censored response,
  5=multiresponse or itemresponse, 6=longitudinal data (with T variables),
  7=binary logistic regression.
 Input choice ([1:7], <cr>=1): 
 Input 1 for least squares, 2 least median of squares ([1:2], <cr>=1): 1
 Choose complexity of model to use at each node:
 Choose 0 for stepwise linear regression (recommended for prediction)
 Choose 1 for multiple regression
 Choose 2 for best simple polynomial in one N or F variable
 Choose 3 for constant fit (recommended for interpretability or if there is an R variable)
 0: stepwise linear, 1: multiple linear, 2: best simple polynomial, 3: constant,
 4: best simple stepwise ANCOVA ([0:4], <cr>=3): 3
